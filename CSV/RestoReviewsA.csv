It's a much more grown up restaurant compared to the rest of the street.,680

We were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had a chance to order.,3123
Really.,2301
I really loved the different and inovated touch that's the cheff gives to the food.,3405
Our friends have not arrived yet.,3576
They came out over cooked and the cheese was almost non existant.,3702
"I had a terrific meal, and our server guided us toward a very nice wine in our price range, instead of allowing us to purchase a similarly priced wine that wasn't as good.",1911

But the main hit was the whole grilled fish.,3241

"Not sure where the previous reviewer, lonk, dined, but Saul is in a great neighborhood and has great food!",685
"In an area sadly lacking in decent Thai food, this is one of the best spots.",428
Tell them Herky sent you and get a free confused look from the waiter.,3378
Make reservations but expect to be delayed 15-20 minutes as the hosting staff was having difficulty seating guests who arrived with a reservation because they probably had a lot of walk ins being so close to Time Square.,779
The food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes.,916
They don't seem to place an emphasis on specials or fresh ingredients which to me is necessary for good thai.,2194
Other apetizers and food,1066
The noodle and rices dishes taste great.,127
The food's as good as ever.,427
"The crust is thin, the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly.",2298
Your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem!,269
Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.,3169
"the food was undercooked-the sauce watery, and the vegetables raw.",3335
And the fried clams had just enough kick to them to make 'em worth eating.,2356
The sauces used are also not that exciting.,1199
The secret is the lunch menu which offers a complimentary appetizer with every entree ordered.,2444
I absolutely love this place!!!,720
The rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard.,340
We had champagne and caviar and felt like princesses!,228
The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.,651
I am surprised to say the least and find such practice not worth the effort.,2664
"When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.",1930
"I got the $10 10-piece dim sum combo, every bite of which was great.",2090
There are other Vietnamese restaurants in the chinatown area and you can forget about those.,977
There is also very limited seating and there can be a substantial wait in getting food at peak times.,2433
"If it's just a quick martini at the bar (which I recommend Jeffery's) or a mind blowing Roast Chicken, go to Village!",1949
No thanks!!!,2757

I lOVE THIS PLACE!,80
I have never been disappointed but their true strength lays in their amazingly delicious and cheap lunch specials.,2398

"A big disappointment, all around.",1475
And its absolutely DELICIOUS.,1560
No free drink.,2025
I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.,1760

Definitely Highly NOT recommended.,2829
"While they keep the capex to a minimum, they do put some cash into the bagels, because they among the best in the city.",1211
I had a huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of.,177
The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place.,1312
Don't waste money on decor.,1565
They also have a back garden open in the summer - cute and French with outdoor seating - what more could you ask for?,2959
"go to any corned indian restaurant, and the little india strip along east 6 st rules supreme!",3339
I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri.,1659
"Given the incredible architecture surrounding it, this place has no character.",839
I'd call it an 'italian dinner'.,457
my first time here was with my gf for our 12 month anniversary.,1306

I have walked by this place for eons and finally went thanks to a girls' night.,2466

My friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better.,2606

"It's a shame that a nice, convenient place like the Pink Pony can be so ruined by lousy service.",1797
This is the first time Citysearch did't call it right.,404
You should pass on the calamari.,1731

Try the spicy wontons and the salt pepper shrimps.,3261

Best Taiwanese food in NY!,2290

The prices and ambience are especially great considering it's in the West Village.,3519
The soup is pretty good too.,1183
It is so easy to get a reservation at a top place in NYC with a week's notice.,2663

We will definitely go back.,2889
I live in the neighborhood and my friends meet me down here not only for the bar scene but also the promise of The Pizza Place at 3am.,1287
Is just the way it was in days gone by.,476

"The atmosphere isn't the greatest , but I suppose that's how they keep the prices down .",729
The pickles were great addition.,487

"However, it just so happens that there's an even more amazing place just down the street.",2429
"While there are plenty of places to go for a good corned beef sandwich, Katz's has a charm about it.",483

Priced at upper intermediate range.,2795
"The fish was adequate, but inexpertly sliced.",342
I recommend ordering in on a weeknight.,1239

It's very spicy but not offensive.,2888
"they didn't disappoint, service from the second i arrived at the door was extremely pleasant and attentive with almost one server per table.",2938

The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.,408
They used shredded cheese on top!,3703

"I will definetely go back again and again, that's for sure!!!",1998
"I didn't complain, I liked the atmosphere so much.",1904

"The Pad thai, lad nar and various other dishes all look good on paper but, I've had better thai food in less asthetically pleasing places.",2414
Delicious food at a great price but do not go here on a cold day and sit by the front door.,2218
"my picks: Guizhou chicken, fish with hot bean source, fish fillet in spicy source (special menu).",1436
"Overall, I'm still impressed that the place even exists and the prices are quite decent but then again, its Chinatown.",2279

The menu choices are similar but the taste lacked more flavor than it looked.,2278
A must for all the Dosa lovers.,1324
"The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.",1477

"Over price, and small portions .",2916
"Meanwhile, the bartender continued to pour champagne from his reserve after we had finished our bottle and we enjoyed an amuse of turnip soup with pureed basil, gratis.",859

Stepped on my foot on the SECOND time he reached over me to adjust lighting.,514

"That said, I thought Scalini Fedeli was one of the best dining experiences I've EVER had.",2842
Everything about this restaurant was special.,2005

I try my best to give an accurate description of any establishment visited.,1145
While the food was good (certainly no Il Mulino) the service was horrendous.,2855
It is expensive but well worth the money.,652

The all you can eat deal is truly amazing here.,1644

"This is definitely a place that provides the best experience, though, to both A-listers and people walking in off the street.",1880
They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.,2101
